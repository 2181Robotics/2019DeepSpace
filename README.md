# 2019DeepSpace
This year's challenge if Space-themed.
The goals are to fill a cargo ship & a
rocket with dodgeball-like cargo, held
in place by disc-shaped hatches.
At the end of the game there are three
levels a robot can drive/climb on, each
higher one being more points.

Our goals are to be the best hatch bot
possible, with a mechanism in front with
a lift that grabs the hatches from the
pickup station with a flower-like cone,
to then be placed at any 3 different heights.
On the back there is a rotating mechanism
that picks up hatches that have fallen on the ground.

There is a mix of pneumatics, digital and 
analog inputs, and motor types.
